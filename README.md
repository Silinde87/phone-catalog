This React application is a catalog where you can find a collection of more than 1000 phone.
These phones can be visualized thanks to an [API developed for this application](https://github.com/Silinde87/phone-catalog-API).

You can search for phones through the search engine, as well as **edit and delete existing ones, and also create** new models.

I have developed this application using atomic design and test driven development. All components have been tested with **unit tests** and the application has several **e2e tests** to corroborate its robustness.

I also make use of **github actions to run a pipeline** that automates the checking of the tests, and the different rules applied during the build.

The template [create-boilerplate-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-boilerplate-react), also developed by me, was used to start this project.

## How it looks

ðŸ”— [Live Demo](https://phone-catalog-sandy.vercel.app/)

## Quick Start

```
git clone https://github.com/Silinde87/phone-catalog.git
cd phone-catalog
yarn install
yarn start
```

_To assure a correct installation, it is recommended to use a node version higher than v16.13.2_

## Available scripts in the application

### yarn install

> **Install app dependencies**

### yarn start

> **Runs the app** in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### yarn test

> **Launches the unit test runner** (Jest/RTL) in the interactive watch mode.

### yarn cy:open

> **Launches the e2e test runner** (Cypress) in interactive watch mode.

### yarn build

> **Generates a build version ready for deploy**.
